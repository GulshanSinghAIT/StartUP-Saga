# Startup Saga

## This project was scaffolded using vite

> **Compatibility Note:**
> Vite requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 14.18+, 16+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.

With NPM:

```bash
$ npm create vite@latest
```
